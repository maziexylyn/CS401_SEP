Software Engineering Project: Electronic Toll Collection System, "Dash" - Mazie Xylyn | Melinda | Sitara

Overview
--------
- This project only deals with the software aspect of the Dash ecosystem.ï»¿ We expect the physical device to be designed by another company and we are only developing the software.

- The purpose of our software is to help modernize and expedite travel for the everyday commuter through the use of an automated toll paying system.

- Each customer is given a Dash device per vehicle and will be allowed to drive on toll bridges/lanes along the California Freeway System.

- Fares are determined by vehicle axles. Otherwise, discounts are applied if drivers are carpooling or have energy efficient vehicles.

User Interface
--------------
- Our website will allow customers to have an account that is linked to their Dash Device(s) to be able to add money, add vehicles, view toll transactions, etc.

- Our database of customer information is secured within our servers in San Francisco, CA.
